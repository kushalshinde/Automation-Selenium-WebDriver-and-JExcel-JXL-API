# Automation-Selenium-WebDriver-and-JExcel-JXL-API

## Project Background

This is a volunteer project I have worked during my internship at Binghamton University under Prof. Laslie Lander. Some people were working on a research project and part of that research was to collect Computer Science faculty information from all different US universities. They were getting sime problem running their software on few websites. I am listing few of them below:
https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/people/directory.php?type=faculty

https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/faculty

http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/index.html

http://www.cs.arizona.edu/personnel/faculty.html

http://www.cs.indiana.edu/people/index.html

My job was to collect all faculty information from above websites using Selenium WebDriver and JExcel (JXL) API and put them into a MS Excel sheet.
